# RMS Bakery
Creating this website has helped us develop in designing as well as coding sectors. Implementation of various features of HTML,HTML5,CSS,CSS3,JAVASCRIPT etc were learnt. We created a user-friendly Bakery website. Simplifies for the customers to select the products like cake  ,chocolate and donuts based on veg /non-veg selection which can be added in the cart. In the cart, the products can be added as well as removed. When we add an item in cart a pop message is displayed showing that an item added to cart. The Sign Up and Login are designed using CSS3, HTML5 , JAVASCRIPT validation ,also  various database operations like insertion, deletion and updation were performed using PHP. The website includes services like website security which has been provided by using SQL Injection. The shop location can be traced via geolocation in contact page .It also has rich Internet Applications like displaying favourite branches using AJAX and JSON under feedback form in contact page. XML along with  XSL elements was implemented to maintain the data in structured way. Favicons, slideshows ,blinking text , audio ,video ,gallery were used to make website more catchy and attractive. We also provided the facility of uploading recipes in the form of  pdf on our website which can be viewed by the customers. The website building has improved our presentation skills i.e front end.
